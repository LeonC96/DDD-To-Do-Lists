DDD: To-Do Lists

A To-Do Lists app made for iOS. This is my final project for my iOS development class.

This app will allow users to create multiple to-do lists that can be connected with other users to share tasks. All the tasks and information is saved to Googleâ€™s Firebase database. Users will be able to see what tasks are done, in progress and by who's doing them, and what tasks are still available to do.
